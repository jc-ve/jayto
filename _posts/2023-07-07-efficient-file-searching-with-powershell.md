# Efficient File Searching with PowerShell

To search for the string in all files within the folder “C:\inetpub\wwwroot” using PowerShell, you can use the Select-String cmdlet. Here’s an example of how you can accomplish this:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\" -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern "https://"
```

1. **Get-ChildItem** retrieves all files and folders within the specified path.
2. The **-Recurse** parameter ensures that the search is performed recursively, including all subfolders.
3. The output of **Get-ChildItem** is piped (|) to **Select-String**.
4. **Select-String** searches for the specified pattern (“https://”) within the content of each file.
5. The command will display the lines containing the matching pattern, along with the corresponding file names.

This command will only search within text-based files (e.g., .txt, .csv, .xml).
